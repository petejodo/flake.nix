- [ ] secondary round of installations:
  - [ ] yazi (terminal file explorer, useful for niri?)
  - [ ] lazygit
  - [ ] direnv (equivalent to mise?)
  - [ ] delta (diff for git) - going to see if I feel like I really need this
  - [ ] mergiraf (merge utility for git)
  - [ ] bitwarden-desktop (there's also bitwarden tool for rofi)
  - [ ] github's cli
  - [ ] juijitsu (git replacement)
  - [ ] tailscale
- [x] set up niri
- [ ] fix fastfetch logo misalignment when printed from fish
  - seems like a ghostty or fish issue since it doesn't happen on subsequent splits or tabs
- [ ] firefox configs
  - [x] log into firefox account
  - [ ] configure firefox w/ sidebery
  - [ ] set kagi as search engine in firefox
- [x] copy useful aliases from cachyos's fish config
- [ ] helix config for remembering where last left in file?
  - if/when https://github.com/helix-editor/helix/pull/9143 gets merged or rebase and compile myself
- [ ] ghostty keyboard shortcuts e.g. go to left split
- [ ] hide certain applications from desktop (see omarchy repo as an example) e.g.
  - btop
  - helix
  - xterm
  - web (gnome default browser) - there's nix settings that allow for doing this
- [ ] something is adding the following packages that should be removed (can be seen in environment.systemPackages in repl)
  - alacritty
  - foot
- [x] discord tray icon? (for gnome)
- [ ] unlock keyring on login?
- [ ] setup firewall
- [x] fix zoxide, created an alias for `z` but may have not been the right way to initialize
- Keyboard shortcuts
  - [x] Mod + Tab - go to previous focused window
  - [ ] Ctrl + Tab - go to previous focused window of the same application
  - [ ] ??? - dismiss notification
- Niri issues / config
  - [x] swayidle / swaylock
    - switched to hypridle / hyprlock as systemd services
    - [x] switched back to swayidle but its not working
    - [x] hyprlock preventing suspend, logging in then suspends the system
    - [ ] was getting an issue when swayidle was added as a package where it would crash but works without it. Unsure why?
  - [x] better styling of hyprlock, use omarchy's as a guide? 
  - [ ] use niri-switch or niriswitcher instead of just focusing previous window
  - [x] cursor size and theme issue
    - ended up adding adwaita icons, not sure if that's what I want though
    - still don't know where the icons are installed either
  - [x] gnome keyring
  - [x] xdg-desktop-portal-gtk (and -gnome)
  - [x] polkit_gnome
    - [x] test via `systemctl --user status polkit-gnome-authentication-agent-1`
  - [ ] kind of long boot time from pressing enter in gdm to seeing desktop, black screen for a bit 
- Noctalia issues / config
  - [ ] Track configuration in `~/.flake`
  - [ ] Audio tray icon doesn't work correctly when on my sony headphones
  - [ ] Widget that opens when clicking the date/time tray icon still displaying 24 hour clock
    - may be fixed already
  - [ ] Remove config for overview when mouse goes to top-left corner
  - [ ] Screen recording not working, requires a specific xdg- package, noctalia docs mention it
  - [x] Need to set up wallpaper
