# TODO

- [ ] secondary round of installations:
  - [ ] yazi (terminal file explorer, useful for niri?)
  - [ ] lazygit
  - [ ] direnv (equivalent to mise?) - look into devshells and how this plays into it
  - [ ] delta (diff for git) - going to see if I feel like I really need this
  - [ ] mergiraf (merge utility for git)
  - [ ] bitwarden-desktop (there's also bitwarden tool for rofi)
  - [ ] github's cli
  - [ ] juijitsu (git replacement)
  - [ ] tailscale
  - [ ] tldr (when you just want examples instead of paragraphs from man-pages)
- [x] set up niri
- [ ] fix fastfetch logo misalignment when printed from fish
  - seems like a ghostty or fish issue since it doesn't happen on subsequent splits or tabs
- [ ] firefox configs
  - [x] log into firefox account
  - [x] configure firefox w/ sidebery
  - [x] style userChrome.css
  - [x] style homepage with userContent.css

- [ ] ghostty keyboard shortcuts e.g. go to left split
- [ ] hide certain applications from desktop (see omarchy repo as an example) e.g.
  - btop
  - helix
  - xterm
  - web (gnome default browser) - there's nix settings that allow for doing this
- [ ] something is adding the following packages that should be removed (can be seen in environment.systemPackages in repl)
  - alacritty
  - foot
- [x] discord tray icon? (for gnome)
- [ ] unlock keyring on login?
  - likely can't be done w/ autologin enabled
- [ ] setup firewall
  - skipping since this isn't laptop but will have to revisit when adding my laptop to this configuration
- [x] fix zoxide, created an alias for `z` but may have not been the right way to initialize
- [ ] was getting an issue when swayidle was added as a package where it would crash but works without it. Unsure why?
- [ ] kind of long boot time from pressing enter in gdm to seeing niri, black screen for a bit 
- [ ] use app switcher next niri release instead of just focusing previous window
- [ ] setup mozilla vpn but consider just using mulvad directly
- Noctalia issues / config
  - [ ] Track configuration in `~/.flake`
  - [ ] Audio tray icon doesn't work correctly when on my sony headphones
  - [ ] Widget that opens when clicking the date/time tray icon still displaying 24 hour clock
    - may be fixed already
  - [ ] Remove config for overview when mouse goes to top-left corner
  - [ ] Screen recording not working, requires a specific xdg- package, noctalia docs mention it
  - [x] Need to set up wallpaper
